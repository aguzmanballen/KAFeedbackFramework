# KAFeedbackFramework

I created a framework that provides feedback in realtime when a user types code into the 
embedded Ace editor. The website shows what functionality is required from the WhiteList,
and also shows what functionality should not be in the code from the BlackList.

This is the first time I've ever worked with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and I learned a ton 
from the project! I wish I had more time to implement the code structure feature, but hopefully
this project demonstrates that I'm eager to jump into any technology and make something out of 
it. In this case, I'm so excited to see that I created a website that provides realtime code 
feedback when just few days prior, I couldn't tell you how to initialize a string variable 
in JavaScript!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask at aguzman4@illinois.edu. Thank you 
and I'm looking forward to hearing from you and any feedback that you have!
